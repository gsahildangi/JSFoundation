<!-- This Boolean attribute is set to indicate to a browser that the script is meant to be executed 
     after the document has been parsed, but before firing DOMContentLoaded.

    Scripts with the defer attribute will prevent the DOMContentLoaded event from firing until the script 
    has loaded and finished evaluating.

    This attribute must not be used if the src attribute is absent (i.e. for inline scripts), in this case 
    it would have no effect. -->
