                                    //a common exapmle is constructor function is a prototype that js provide 
 
// A prototype in JavaScript is an object that other objects inherit properties and methods from.
// Every JavaScript object has a prototype, which acts as a template for sharing functionality.
// When you create an object(for example, using a constructor function), JavaScript automatically 
// links it to a prototype, allowing objects to share common behavior efficiently.This is the foundation 
// of JavaScriptâ€™s inheritance system.

//Now lets check that when we link the basicComputer __proto__ in lenovo object .Lets try to use the 
//functionality of basicComputer object in lenevo object

console.log(`Using basicComputer functionality : ` , lenovo.screen); // as this screen is common in both the objects
                    // so this lenovo pick up its screen feature and output is  "1080"

console.log('Lets try to print every __proto__of  "myHardware " all the object when they link to each other :', myHardwareCompany.__proto__ );

// Output: DO check this and find out what is going on.
// Lets try to print every __proto__of basicComputer all the object when they link to each other : [Object: null prototype] {}     
// Lets try to print every __proto__of "lenovo" all the object when they link to each other : { ram: 4, cpu: 12, screen: 720 }
