                                             "Js"

Parsing: Now parsing is reading the code file and then storing the keywords like console,for,class and then understand
         what user wants.


    [Before the code run-time]     
               |
 {[code file]->parse->[syntax tree]}--->{[JIT(just in time)Conpiler]}--->{First it[byte code]->[machine code]}--->[Code Execution]  
  
   This is the execition cycle of the javascript code 
 
 Kaywords in above diagram:
 JIT compiler  first change the code in just byte code file and then compiler convert it into Machine code.


 Type of DataTypes:

 So there are basically 2 types:
    - Primitive   - String, Boolean, Number, null, undefined ,Symbol
    - Non Primitive - Object, Array, function 


    The array method Slice() :  is correct because it creates a shallow copy of a s
    pecified portion of an array without modifying the original array, aligning perfectly with the 
    question's requirement. This makes it a fundamental tool for working with arrays in programming, 
    reinforcing your understanding of array manipulation.
